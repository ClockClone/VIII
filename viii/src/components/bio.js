					Hi my name is Troy Washington, I've been coding for over a year now. I
					took a momentary break from coding/developing/hacking over the summer
					of 2023 but now I am back and ready to start pushing some code. My
					hobbies are skating, video games, and riding my bike. My interest are
					boxing, baseball, philosophy and computer engineering. Please don't be
					afraid to message me if you are interested in collaborating on a
					project.
